这是“忆心”创作的研究日志，公开于此 是希望我能始终铭记我的理念“为孤独中的人们提供一种可能性，我们不是希望用户离不开它，而是希望忆心所提供的赋能，让用户更从容的离开”
This is the research log for Project Yixin. It is made public as a reminder to myself—and to others—of its founding conviction: to offer a possibility for those who feel alone, not to create dependency, but to empower users with such clarity and strength that they can walk away from it with greater ease and autonomy

这几日我一直在思考，随着对项目的深入 问题也越来越多，我不禁思考起忆心的价值，它的周遭像有一阵雾，让我害怕，迷茫。或许吧，有些问题我缺少解答，我只能先将它交由我最初的设想-“朋友”

These past few days, I have been deep in thought. As I delve further into the project, the questions have only multiplied. I can't help but ponder the true value of "Yixin." It feels surrounded by a kind of haze, which leaves me fearful and adrift.
Perhaps, for some questions, I simply lack the answers. For now, I can only entrust it to my original, foundational conception—that of a "friend."

在创作中 我似乎只是对单方面的完善，却忽略了，如果是日常简单的交流，“忆心”也要完整的进行大量的文本回复吗？这显得它有点繁杂，它应该有一个“响应强度调节器" 搭配多模态情绪识别来有效进行 
第一级（用于日常低强度情绪）
触发条件：用户提及简单烦躁、短暂低落。
响应模式：情感确认 → 轻量引导
第二级：标准陪伴（用于需要梳理的中等情绪）
触发条件：用户明确提及与过往核心痛苦相关的信号。
响应模式：情感确认 → 叙事连接（提及该主题在记忆库中的存在） → 提供选择
第三级（用于强烈情绪反噬或危机时刻）
触发条件：系统检测到用户语言中带有强烈痛苦、自我否定或无助感。
响应模式：启动完整协议（包含情感锚定、叙事重构、美好勘探和伙伴契约）。                                      
危机资源转接（如必要）：“我始终在这里。同时，我有一个非常重要的信息需要确保你知道：这里有7x24小时可用的专业支持热线.
我们要明确”忆心“的定位，
In the creative process, I seem to have focused on perfecting a single mode of interaction, overlooking a key practical question: for simple, everyday exchanges, must "Yixin" always deliver lengthy, full-protocol text responses? That would make it feel cumbersome. It needs a "Response Intensity Regulator," working in tandem with multimodal emotion recognition, to operate efficiently.

Level 1: For Daily Low-Intensity Moods
Trigger Conditions: User mentions simple irritations, brief low moods.
Response Mode: Emotional Validation → Light Guidance

Level 2: Standard Companion Mode (For Moderate Emotions Requiring Processing)
Trigger Conditions: User explicitly mentions signals related to core, past pain.
Response Mode: Emotional Validation → Narrative Connection (referencing the theme's presence in the memory bank) → Offering Choices

Level 3: For Intense Emotional Overwhelm or Crisis Moments
Trigger Conditions: System detects language indicating severe distress, self-negation, or helplessness.
Response Mode: Activate the full protocol (including Emotional Anchoring, Narrative Reframing, Positive Memory Exploration, and the Partnership Pact).

Crisis Resource Handoff (if necessary): "I am always here. Simultaneously, I have very important information I need to ensure you know: There is a 24/7 professional support hotline available.
We must be clear about Yixin's role and positioning."
