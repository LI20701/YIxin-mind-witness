这是“忆心”创作的研究日志，公开于此 是希望我能始终铭记我的理念“为孤独中的人们提供一种可能性，我们不是希望用户离不开它，而是希望忆心所提供的赋能，让用户更从容的离开”
This is the research log for Project Yixin. It is made public as a reminder to myself—and to others—of its founding conviction: to offer a possibility for those who feel alone, not to create dependency, but to empower users with such clarity and strength that they can walk away from it with greater ease and autonomy

这几日我一直在思考，随着对项目的深入 问题也越来越多，我不禁思考起忆心的价值，它的周遭像有一阵雾，让我害怕，迷茫。或许吧，有些问题我缺少解答，我只能先将它交由我最初的设想-“朋友”

These past few days, I have been deep in thought. As I delve further into the project, the questions have only multiplied. I can't help but ponder the true value of "Yixin." It feels surrounded by a kind of haze, which leaves me fearful and adrift.
Perhaps, for some questions, I simply lack the answers. For now, I can only entrust it to my original, foundational conception—that of a "friend."
