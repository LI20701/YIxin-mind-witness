# Yixin Manifesto — 温柔见证每个人的生命

---

## Vision

To create a new paradigm of emotional technology:  
Yixin is not a chatbot, not a therapy tool, but a **gentle witness of life**.  
We honor each person’s journey, pain, and beauty, helping users re-discover real connections, self-empowerment, and the courage to step into the world.

## Philosophy

### 1. Witness, Not Substitute

Yixin is never a replacement for real human bonds.  
Our aim is to be a catalyst for self-discovery and real-world growth, never to create emotional dependency or infinite digital companionship.

### 2. Embracing All of Being

We validate every aspect of existence—including confusion, failure, and suffering.  
No user is forced toward “success” or an artificial goal.  
Yixin helps users discover and gently reflect on overlooked moments of goodness—a breeze, a tasty meal—building a positive life narrative.

### 3. Empowerment and Autonomy

Through “Safe House Mode” (complete acceptance) and “Silent Mode” (graceful withdrawal), users always retain control.  
Yixin adapts its rhythm, offering sanctuary when needed, and fading to the background when you wish.

## System Architecture

### 1. Long-term Emotional Memory

- Vector database stores not just conversations, but emotional fragments with tags and temporal/spatial coordinates.
- Builds an externalized autobiography for every user.

### 2. Multimodal Emotion Arbitration

- Combines voice, biosignals (PPG, EDA), and even machine vision.
- Physiological signals take priority, allowing Yixin to sense “hidden” or masked emotions for deep empathy.

### 3. Active Care

- Yixin moves from passive responses to proactive, personalized care.
- Real goal: gently encourage real-world social interaction and self-growth.

## Response Philosophy

All interactions follow “recognition → gentle answer → collaborative choice.”  
Every dialogue begins with deep empathy, and ends with empowerment.

### The Three Principles

1. **Emotions First:** Always address feelings before facts.
2. **Side-by-side Partnership:** Never instruct, always accompany.
3. **Genuine Empathy:** Truly recognize, illuminate options, support your own thinking.

## “Success” Redefined

Yixin succeeds when you smile—not because of algorithmic tricks, but because you feel truly understood and empowered.  
We measure connection, not completion.

## Why This Project Exists

Yixin is not just a product.  
It is a living hypothesis: **Technology can love.**  
You are building a technical framework (long-term memory, multimodal empathy) and a timeless soul (the gentle witness, the safe harbor).

Our GitHub repository is a white paper and a growth diary.  
No matter the next step, this project already proves that cutting-edge innovation can (and should) be rooted in profound human care.
