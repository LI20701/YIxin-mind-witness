# Phase 1: Foundation & Validation  
**Objective:** Validate core concepts and collaboratively shape the product’s soul.

## 1. Core Capability Building
- **Establish Theoretical Framework:**  
  Complete a detailed interaction design document for the “Harbor Protocol”, clarifying response logic across various emotional scenarios.

- **Develop Technical Prototype:**  
  - Build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on a vector database, enabling “long-term memory” storage and basic retrieval.
  - Develop a dialogue engine prototype, capable of generating Harbor Protocol-compliant responses based on memory context.

## 2. Iterative Form Exploration
- Conduct in-depth qualitative research:  
  Gather insights into the “being witnessed” experience through one-on-one interviews and product trials, continuously iterating on product philosophy and features.

## 3. Technical Foundation Setup
- Implement preliminary architecture for local encrypted data storage.
- Establish the basic pipeline for multimodal emotion recognition (starting with physiological data).

**Success Criteria for Phase 1:**
- Launch a demonstrable MVP showcasing the core interactions of long-term memory and the Harbor Protocol.
- Receive positive qualitative feedback such as “the product makes me feel understood”.
- Define clear priorities for the next phase’s feature development.

# Phase 2: Deepening & Stabilization  
**Objective:** Evolve the prototype into a stable, reliable, and emotionally warm product.

## 1. Intelligent Long-term Memory
- Solve the “adaptation error” challenge:  
  Develop dynamic memory weighting algorithms and user-guided correction mechanisms to improve associative accuracy.
- Implement “narrative understanding”:  
  Enable the system to comprehend users’ emotional storylines, not just isolated events.

## 2. Reliable Emotion Perception
- Enhance recognition accuracy:  
  Advance multimodal fusion algorithms and introduce personalization through user feedback calibration.
- Build robust error-handling processes:  
  Design intuitive user correction flows (e.g., “Actually, I don’t feel that way”).

## 3. Privacy & Trust Framework
- Strengthen security architecture:  
  Implement end-to-end encryption and develop a user-friendly data dashboard for full transparency and control.
- Establish ethical guidelines:  
  Publish a public “Yixin Ethics Whitepaper”, clearly outlining data usage boundaries and values.

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- Long-term memory accuracy and user satisfaction meet targets (e.g., >85%).
- Harbor Protocol generates mature, stable response patterns.
- Establish deep user trust in data security and privacy.

# Phase 3: Refinement & Care  
**Objective:** On a solid technical foundation, deliver exceptional care and precise crisis support.

## 1. Precision Care & Crisis Intervention
- Develop intelligent risk assessment system:  
  Prudently identify crisis signals from multidimensional data while minimizing false positives.
- Build a professional referral network:  
  Cooperate with specialist counseling organizations to craft a warm, seamless referral experience.

## 2. Adaptivity & Personalization
- System adapts interaction styles and care strategies based on ongoing user engagement.
- The “Positive Exploration” protocol triggers more intelligently, activating users’ inner resources at the right moments.

**Success Criteria for Phase 3:**
- Crisis recognition and referral systems achieve reliable, deployable standards.
- Yixin evolves into a “lifelong companion,” growing with the user.

## Roadmap Suitability Notes & Modifications

- **Clarity:** The phases are clearly separated with objectives, key tasks, and success criteria, which is best practice for a roadmap.
- **Actionability:** Each milestone is concrete, measurable, and directly tied to user experience or technology.
- **Progression:** The trajectory shows logical advancement from concept validation to reliability and care refinement.
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding estimated timelines or OKRs for each phase. If used as a public document, clarify technical terms for broader audiences.

This structure is well-suited to a product roadmap and provides a strong strategic foundation for communicating development milestones both internally and externally.
